        We seem to associate a high screen time with a “screen addiction”, implying that the more time we spend in cyberspace, the more we form an unhealthy detachment from our physical realities. After seeing a dramatic increase in my own screen time over the last few years, I have begun to wonder whether our dependence on cyberspace for daily life is an unhealthy addiction, or is it rather an indicator that we as a society have transformed the way we experience reality?
      </p>

      <p class="twoColumn">
        Since spending the better part of two years cooped up in my bedroom on my computer all day long due to the dangers of the COVID-19 pandemic, I have found that my relationship with cyberspace has drastically changed. While I used to find myself becoming bored with staring at a screen, I now am able to immerse myself into the digital world so much that I seem to forget that I exist in a physical space. There have been times that I forget to eat, brush my teeth, shower, and times where I barely move all day because of how easily I slip into the digital world and lose track of the physical one. This has led me to ask myself: what is it that makes this immersion so intuitive?
      </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h1 class="fullWidth">Mindless Content Consumption</h1>


      <p class="fullWidth">
        My personal theory is that we have been able to satisfy traditionally analog human urges with digital replacements. One example of the way in which digital content is designed to replicate satisfying real-world experiences is through viewership of daily activities. In particular, watching people do things we ourselves wish to be doing helps us to feel satisfied on a surface level, and keeps us on our screens rather than up and actually doing the things we may need to do.
      </p>
      <p class="fullWidth">
        For example, when we feel hungry but don’t want to get up to eat, we might watch a video of someone else eating to feel satisfied. When we crave human connection and play, we entertain a parasocial relationship with gamers online, as if we are playing along with them. When we have piles of work to do and feel the need to be productive, we would rather watch a video of someone else getting their life together than do it ourselves because we can feel productive vicariously through them without having to put any real effort into it. And when we want to feel like we’ve done a lot with our day instead of having sat in bed for hours, we watch people’s busy “day in the life” videos to fill the void.
      </p>
      <p class="fullWidth">
          At the end of the day, however, after consuming all of this content to satisfy my urges on a shallow level, I have neglected my physical self. My body is not clean nor nourished, my social relationships are left to dry, my work is not done, and my day was spent trying to avoid the feeling of emptiness that these realities leave me with. When I ask myself why I even consume this content when I know it isn’t really helping me, I realize just how strangely addictive it is. I often find myself mindlessly scrolling through my phone to escape any minor inconveniences in my life or when I’m avoiding doing something I need to do (and this experience must be somewhat universal because as I was typing out the word “mindlessly” while writing this, my predictive text software suggested the phrase “mindlessly scrolling” to me). It seems that we only keep up this behavior because of the dopamine-driven feedback loop it offers us.
      </p>
      <p class="fullWidth">
      This life that is halfway between the virtual and physical world, where neither side of the coin is fully satisfied, leaves us with unhealthy habits. By this logic, in order to be healthy we must commit to one side: physical or virtual. We know what it is like to live life solely in the physical realm: humans have been doing it for centuries. What if, however, we could find a healthy life solely in the virtual world?

      <h1 class="fullWidth">The Experience Machine</h1>

      <p class="fullWidth">
        In his essay “The Experience Machine”, Robert Nozick explores this idea by asking the question of whether or not people would use a life experience simulation machine if such a thing existed. He argues that even if the machine could perfectly emulate any experience one desired, people would still not use it to replace their daily lives because humans crave the reality of life. Even if the experience machine could be fully immersive to the extent that the user believes it’s actually happening, Nozick believes that as people we seek to actually do things rather than only live the experience of them.
      </p>
        <p class="fullWidth">
          He also points out that a reason that we would not choose this alternative reality is because we could only experience what humans have designed. Limiting ourselves to a man-made world would inherently rid ourselves of a true connection to nature or anything outside the scope of our own imaginations and capabilities. Nozick then discusses how the use of psychoactive substances can be seen as either a sort of local experience machine or as an “avenue to a deeper reality”. He claims that this conflict is clarified by the idea that “There is no actual contact with any deeper reality, though the experience of it can be simulated. Many persons desire to leave themselves open to such contact and to a plumbing of deeper significance” (Nozick).
        </p>
      <p class = "fullWidth">
        Nozick then extends his argument that people would not use the experience machine to the claim that people would also not use a hypothetical transformation machine. Even if a machine could allow us to be whatever person we’d like to be while still being ourselves, Nozick believes that we would not use it. His argument is based on the idea that we would be too removed from our true sense of self and reality if our experiences and selves were a simulation, and so our lives would not be satisfying in the way they currently are. He reaches the conclusion that “perhaps what we desire is to live (an active verb) ourselves, in contact with reality. (And this, machines cannot do for us)” (Nozick).
      </p>
      <p class="fullWidth">
        With our current technological capabilities, it is hard to imagine that a life of simulated experiences and false identity could be as satisfying and rewarding than one that is engaged in reality. This is enforced by the currently unhealthy relationships with escapism in cyberspace that many of us (including myself) have adopted. However, I am not convinced that there is no way in which we could live virtual lives that leave us feeling fulfilled, nor that we as a society would not take the opportunity to simulate our lives if we could. The science fiction novel "Ready Player One" by Ernest Cline explores this idea of a world in which humans live in a virtual reality and experience everything, including relationships and all interactions, through a computer and VR headset.
      </p>
      <p class="fullWidth">
        After reading this book, I am inclined to agree with Cline that this is a fairly plausible future, as we have already taken certain steps in this direction since the invention of the VR experience in day-to-day life (in entertainment such as gaming, as well as media consumption such as movies and even pornography). Taking into consideration that Nozick’s essay was published in 1975, far before the advent of smart devices, let alone VR machines, it is understandable that for Nozick it was much harder to imagine a world in which people would actually subscribe to the “experience machine”. In our modern society, however, it is really not so far-fetched to argue that perhaps we would use the experience machine if we had the chance to.

      <h1 class="fullWidth">Avatars</h1>

      <p class="fullWidth">
      But if we were to surrender to the virtual world and live in a digital simulation, how would we preserve our sense of identity? Well, one of the ways virtual systems currently attempt to preserve a user’s sense of self is through avatars.
    </p>

      <p class="fullWidth">
        Graphical representations of a user’s persona, avatars can be anything from a simple 2-D profile picture to a hyper realistically rendered 3-D model of a character. Depending on the level of fidelity and the role an avatar plays in a virtual world, users may dedicate their real time, money, and emotions to the betterment of their digital avatar. There are many examples of people using their avatars to fulfill a certain goal or aspiration that is not achievable to them in the physical world, or simply taking care of their virtual avatars because it is easier to do so than to care of oneself physically.
      </p>

      <p class="fullWidth">
        In the TV show “The Office”, for example, one of the characters Dwight was playfully teased by his coworker Jim for being active on “Second Life”: a real-life online multimedia platform that allows players to create avatars and live a second life virtually. In the show, Dwight’s second life is identical to his real life, despite how banal his lifestyle may seem (for context, he works as a paper salesman in Scranton, Pennsylvania). He is so determined to make his avatar accurate to himself, though, that his virtual self actually has its own virtual second life, under the name “Second Second Life”. Jim jokes that this shows that Dwight has an unhealthy detachment from reality, and the whole bit is used as evidence that Dwight is taking a breakup very seriously and is struggling to cope. Meanwhile, Jim himself has an avatar that he uses to live out his personal fantasies, being a sportswriter in Philadelphia who can play the guitar. This example serves to represent the different ways in which avatars can be used for escapism. For Dwight, it is an opportunity to live out his daily life in a world that is the exact same as his except untainted by heartbreak, and for Jim it is a chance to feel closer to his ideal life.

      <p class="fullWidth">
      In my own life, the Sims has been the major player in the world of virtual avatar games. One of the best selling video game series of all time, the Sims is a simulation game that allows players to create avatars and complete basic tasks with them, such as cleaning, eating, and building their lives. I distinctly remember playing this game as a child as a means to live out my “perfect life”. I created an avatar that looked like the ideal version of myself in the future, and I spent hours building every facet of her life, from her wardrobe to her friendships to her cleaning schedule. Looking back on this time, I realize that I used the Sims as a way to fantasize about my dream life, but many use it as a means to live experiences that they cannot afford in their real lives. In fact, this form of escapism is so normalized that a
      <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/jul/31/holiday-sims-4-cottage-living-pc-ps-xbox">2021 article from the Guardian </a>
      promotes purchasing Sims 4: The Cottage Life instead of going on an actual cottage vacation.</p>

      <p class="fullWidth">
      Avatars are increasingly popular forms of virtual user representation. One of the most widely used forms of this is the Snapchat Bitmoji, a cartoon version of yourself that is used as a vehicle for communication with primarily friends. Mostly popular among Gen-Z youth in the U.S., the Bitmoji has become a rather instrumental part of our culture, as it is almost assumed that every Gen-Z American has one. </p>

      <p class="fullWidth">
        It’s looking like the future will hold an even greater emphasis on the importance of avatars in our daily lives. With the potential development of a universal Metaverse on the horizon, 3-D avatars that resemble our real selves may soon be our replacements. Will avatars be our ticket to a form of healthy escapism in cyberspace that allows us to preserve our identities? Or will they just be another vehicle for unhealthy escape? Only time will tell.
